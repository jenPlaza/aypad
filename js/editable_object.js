    mission:
      'The Snail Farm Project aims at providing low cost meat in our countries of operation while also providing employment that will generate income for marginalized population. AYPAD detected that snails are a high source of protein and cheaper than other animals meat, thus more accessible for population. Therefore we intend to commence this project with snail farming andat a later stage we would develop other farm types, to name a few: guinea fowl, turkey or pigs.These animals will be provided to the participants after being trained to properly manage their farms. AYPAD will help with marketing the product of our farmers after being harvested. Achatina snail is a delicacy for the citizens of West Africa, Europe and Asia. In Ghana is eaten by about half of the 35 million population. The snail is traditionally gathered from the wild and sold at the local markets. However, in recent years, the Achatina snail has greatly diminished due to overharvesting, adverse weather conditions, and deforestation. The limited supply of snail keeps the cost prohibitively high, and thus keeps the nutritious food out of the hands and mouths of the consumers who want and need it most. AYPAD Snail Farm which will commence first project in Ghana assisting women, mostly commercial sex workers, single mothers and local farmers in raising the large snails, thus providing a sustainable supply of the highly sought-after snail in the Ghanaian market.',

African cultures are unique, strong and very different throughout the continent. It is the belief of the organization that as the youth in Africa, we should be culturally oriented. Therefore, the main aim of the AYPAD Cultural Program is to engage youth and children in cultural activities to promote peace and develop their talents providing a context outside formal institutions where youth can come together to better understand each other and their culture. With the help of WayOut Arts Organization, based in England, AYPAD received support to buy equipment (dance costumes and drums) to start running the cultural programs. The cultural group seeks to do this by providing youth with training and a place in which to dance and drum together as a cohesive group. AYPAD seeks to support this program and the youth within it by performing in a variety of spaces including cultural festivals, sensitization projects, conferences, and tourist venues. Through these performances, AYPAD hopes to create funds to ensure that all members of the troupe are able to attend school and have their basic housing and food needs met. Presently the organization offers cultural dance or drumming training for interested individuals or groups; if any organization need a cultural group to perform, they can also contact us.',

    mission:
      'AYPAD Basic Education Project has the purpose of giving African street children access to education and thus reintegrating them into society. Due to the continent’s poor economic and social conditions, children often do not have access to education. The project counteracts this injustice by offering educational programs for children aged between 6 and 17. Furthermore, an individual curriculum that is tailored to the children’s special needs is developed with the aim of reintegrating the children into the educational system. The initiative reduces the risk of social exclusion and the threat of slipping into the abysses of crime. AYPAD hope the project will contributes significantly to the reduction of poverty in Africa. To escape the vicious circle of poverty, children have to be empowered and given access to high quality education. Our Filmmaking Project aims to promote education, inspire social change and encourage creative self-expression by teaching the basics of filmmaking: how to write, direct, act in, shoot and produce their own films. Additionally, students will be responsible for event management and marketing as well. The classes will offer a safe and stimulating learning environment where students can acquire valuable skills and knowledge which could be exceedingly beneficial for their education, and future earning ability. We strongly believe that Within the confines of the programme, children will be taught filmmaking techniques. They will gain practical and theoretical knowledge, learning from books and teachers who are trained and knowledgeable in filmmaking. To afford the necessary filmmaking tools and equipment, second hand products will be sought. A wide range of tools and equipment will be available so that the students have experience in learning about cameras, audio, lighting, directing, developing a story and scriptwriting among others.',

    mission:
      'AYPAD Basic Education Project has the purpose of giving African street children access to education and thus reintegrating them into society. Due to the continent’s poor economic and social conditions, children often do not have access to education. The project counteracts this injustice by offering educational programs for children aged between 6 and 17. Furthermore, an individual curriculum that is tailored to the children’s special needs is developed with the aim of reintegrating the children into the educational system. The initiative reduces the risk of social exclusion and the threat of slipping into the abysses of crime. AYPAD hope the project will contributes significantly to the reduction of poverty in Africa. To escape the vicious circle of poverty, children have to be empowered and given access to high quality education. Our Filmmaking Project aims to promote education, inspire social change and encourage creative self-expression by teaching the basics of filmmaking: how to write, direct, act in, shoot and produce their own films. Additionally, students will be responsible for event management and marketing as well. The classes will offer a safe and stimulating learning environment where students can acquire valuable skills and knowledge which could be exceedingly beneficial for their education, and future earning ability. We strongly believe that Within the confines of the programme, children will be taught filmmaking techniques. They will gain practical and theoretical knowledge, learning from books and teachers who are trained and knowledgeable in filmmaking. To afford the necessary filmmaking tools and equipment, second hand products will be sought. A wide range of tools and equipment will be available so that the students have experience in learning about cameras, audio, lighting, directing, developing a story and scriptwriting among others.',

Obsessed with the desire to positively transform the lives and living conditions of vulnerable children (boy & girls) and women, AYPAD has been undertaken series of research and documentation of experiences together with suggested recommendations of street children and commercial sex workers, most of whom have subsequently been absorbed into AYPAD’s membership, and gradually acquired coping mechanism skills. AYPAD holds the view that women’s empowerment lies with that economic power and decision making abilities, which would also reflect positively on their lives and their families around them. The rationale of this request is to enhance the economic empowerment of the women members of AYPAD through the provision of revolving Micro-Credit scheme.',
